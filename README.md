# Binary Search Tree (BST)

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, commonly referred to as the left and right children. The tree is structured so that:

- Each node's left child contains a value smaller than the node itself.
- Each node's right child contains a value larger than the node itself.

This property makes **searching**, **insertion**, and **deletion** operations efficient, typically taking O(log n) time in a balanced tree.

### Key Operations
- **Search**: Locate an element in O(log n) time.
- **Insert**: Add a new element while maintaining the BST property.
- **Delete**: Remove an element, possibly restructuring the tree to maintain its properties.

### Example Usage
BSTs are commonly used in:
- Search engines for auto-suggestions
- Databases for indexing
- Sorting algorithms
